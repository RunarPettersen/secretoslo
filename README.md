# Secret Oslo

Secret Oslo is a site I created to experiment further with what I learned during the JavaScript module at Noroff.

## Description

I wanted to deepen my understanding of APIs, and it all started with retrieving information from a couple of free API services to display the weather and time in Oslo. Next, I wanted to experiment more with map functions, GPS, and how to integrate them into a site like this. Using text I had previously written about Oslo, the project took off. Although this was initially a site I created to improve my skills in APIs and JavaScript, I was so pleased with the result that I purchased a domain for it, and the site is now live online.
