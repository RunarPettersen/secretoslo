            <h1>50 Fun Facts About Oslo</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>According to Snorre’s sagas of the Norwegian kings, Oslo was founded around the year 1048 by King Harald Hardråde. However, recent archaeological excavations have uncovered Christian graves dating back to before the year 1000, leading the city to celebrate its 1000-year anniversary in 2000.</li>
        <li>Oslo became the capital of Norway in 1299, during the reign of King Haakon V.</li>
        <li>In the oldest references to Oslo, written in Old Norse, the name appears as both Ásló and Ósló, suggesting that it was originally pronounced with an open "á" sound rather than the closed "ó" used today. These Old Norse forms were Latinized to Asloia and Osloia, and appeared in Low German as Anslo, hinting at a nasal pronunciation.</li>
        <li>The city's name was changed to Christiania (later Kristiania) in 1624 after a devastating fire. It reverted to Oslo in 1925.</li>
        <li>As of 2024 Oslo is ranked on second place on the Global Destination Sustainability-Index (GDS-Index). The GDS-Index is a destination-level performance tool that measures the regenerative strategy and implementation of tourism and events destinations of participating destinations worldwide.</li>
        <li>Oslo is Norway's most populous city, with over 700,000 residents in the city proper and around 1.5 million in the metropolitan area.</li>
        <li>The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo every year, unlike the other Nobel Prizes, which are awarded in Sweden.</li>
        <li><strong>Oslo Opera House:</strong> The Oslo Opera House, designed by the architectural firm Snøhetta, has a roof that slopes directly into the fjord, allowing visitors to walk on it.</li>
        <li><strong>Vigeland Sculpture Park:</strong> Oslo's Vigeland Park is the world's largest sculpture park made by a single artist, featuring over 200 sculptures by Gustav Vigeland.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Capital:</strong> Oslo was named the European Green Capital in 2019 for its commitment to sustainability and environmental protection.</li>
        <li>The carillon at Oslo City Hall is the largest in the Nordic countries with its 49 bells. It often reflects current events and popular culture, creating memorable moments for the city. For instance, when a girl sitting by Akershus Fortress heard the bells play Monty Python’s “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” she couldn't help but smile!” The carillon has also paid tribute to music legends, playing “Purple Rain” after Prince's passing, “Changes” for David Bowie, and “Electricity” for Lemmy from Motörhead, adding a special touch to Oslo’s soundscape!</li>
        <li><strong>Holmenkollen Ski Jump:</strong> Holmenkollen is one of the oldest ski jumps in the world and offers panoramic views of the city and the fjord.</li>
        <li>Oslo set a new cold record on January 6, 2024, with temperatures dipping below -30°C for the first time at an official weather station. The record low of -31.1°C was recorded at Bjørnholt in Nordmarka between 4 and 5 a.m. on that frosty Saturday morning!</li>
        <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Despite its northern location, Oslo has a relatively mild climate due to the Gulf Stream, with warm summers and cold, snowy winters.</li>
        <li><strong>Island Hopping:</strong> The Oslofjord has several islands accessible by ferry, popular for swimming, picnicking, and exploring.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Transport:</strong> Oslo boasts an efficient public transportation system, including trams, buses, ferries, and a metro that reaches into the surrounding forests.</li>
        <li><strong>Bike-Friendly:</strong> The city has been expanding its network of bike lanes and bike-sharing services, making it easy to explore Oslo by bicycle.</li>
        <li>In 1878, 81 numbered boundary stones were set up between Kristiania (now Oslo) and Aker herred to mark the city’s expansion. Stone No. 1 was placed at Kongshavn in the east, and No. 81 at Frognerkilen in the west. Each stone is marked with an "A" for Aker on one side and a "K" for Kristiania on the other, along with a crown and the stone’s number on both sides. As of 2020, just under half of these stones still exist, with most of the preserved ones located among the lower numbers. Some stones have even been moved from their original locations over time due to urban development!</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse Architecture:</strong> Oslo's architecture ranges from medieval fortresses to modernist buildings like the Barcode Project, a series of high-rise buildings near the waterfront.</li>

        <li>Oslo's municipal seal features the city's patron saint, St. Hallvard, seated on a lion-headed throne. In his left hand, he holds the three arrows that were used to kill him, and in his right hand, he holds the millstone that his murderers tied to him to sink his body in the Drammensfjord.</li>
        <li>Oslo’s municipal seal includes a somewhat controversial detail: a nude woman lying at his feet. This figure symbolizes the woman St. Hallvard tried to save from attackers, but the story behind her presence is based on a historical misunderstanding! Originally, the medieval seal depicted a warrior in chainmail and armor, representing the evil forces St. Hallvard overcame through his good deeds. However, a misinterpretation of the legend in the 1800s replaced the warrior with the naked woman we see today, making the seal a unique blend of myth and mix-up in Oslo's history!</li>

        <li><strong>Cultural Diversity:</strong> Oslo is one of the most diverse cities in Scandinavia, with a significant population of immigrants and people of various cultural backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Oslo is often called "Tigerstaden" (the Tiger City), a nickname inspired by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson’s poem "Sidste Sang" (later called "Godt Mod") from 1870. The poem depicts a battle between a country horse and a city tiger, symbolizing Oslo as a dangerous and unforgiving metropolis. Although originally used as a derogatory term, "Tigerstaden" has evolved into a positive symbol of the city. To mark Oslo's millennium celebration in 2000, a bronze tiger sculpture by Elena Engelsen was placed at Jernbanetorget, with other tiger statues appearing at Fridtjof Nansen's Square near Oslo City Hall and other locations, embracing the city's wild side!</li>
