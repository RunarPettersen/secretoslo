    </ul>

    <h2>2. Getting Around</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Transport:</strong> Oslo has an excellent public transport system, including buses, trams, ferries, and the metro. The same ticket works for all of them, inlcuding train within the Oslo area, and can be bought as one hour, 24 hours, one week, or one month.

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Currency and Payment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Norway uses the Norwegian krone (NOK). Credit and debit cards are widely accepted, even for small purchases, so there's no need to carry a lot of cash.</li>
        <li>Contactless payments and mobile payment apps like Vipps are popular and commonly used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Language</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Norwegian is the official language, but English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas. You’ll find that most Norwegians are fluent in English and happy to help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Weather and Packing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Oslo’s weather can change quickly, so pack layers that you can add or remove as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Waterproof Gear:</strong> Even in summer, rain showers are common, so a waterproof jacket or umbrella is a good idea.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfortable Shoes:</strong> Oslo is best explored on foot, so bring comfortable walking shoes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Attractions and Activities</h2>

        <li><strong>Must-See:</strong> Don't miss the Oslo Opera House, Vigeland Sculpture Park, the Viking Ship Museum, and the Munch Museum.</li>

        <li><strong>Holmenkollen Ski Jump:</strong> Even if you don’t ski, the ski jump offers stunning views of the city and a fascinating ski museum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Dining and Food</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Try Local Cuisine:</strong> Sample traditional Norwegian dishes like seafood, reindeer, and cured meats. For a more modern take, Oslo's food scene includes a variety of international and Nordic-inspired restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Tap Water:</strong> Tap water in Oslo is clean, fresh, and safe to drink. Save money by carrying a refillable water bottle.</li>

    <h2>8. Saving Money</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oslo Pass:</strong> This pass offers free entry to many museums and attractions, free travel on public transport, and discounts on tours and restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Picnics and Street Food:</strong> Eating out can be expensive, so consider picnicking in one of Oslo’s many parks or grabbing food from local markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Safety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oslo is generally a safe city with low crime rates. However, as in any large city, stay aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded places.</li>
        <li>Look out for bikes and trams when crossing the street; they often have the right of way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Respect for Nature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Norwegians have a strong connection to nature, and it's important to respect it by following "leave no trace" principles. Dispose of your trash properly and stick to marked paths in natural areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Cultural Etiquette</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Norwegians value personal space and may seem reserved at first. A polite greeting and a smile go a long way.</li>
        <li>Tipping is not mandatory, but it's appreciated for good service. Round up the bill or leave 10% if you're happy with the service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Weather Apps and Local Updates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Download a reliable weather app like Yr.no or the official Visit Oslo app for up-to-date information on weather, events, and transportation.</li>
